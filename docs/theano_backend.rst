=====================
Theano implementation
=====================

`Theano <http://deeplearning.net/software/theano/>`_
is a Python package that do the types of computations
that Nengo requires very fast by transparently
creating, compiling, and running C code.
The generated C code can target multicore CPUs, GPUs,
and other computing devices.
However, Theano can be difficult to install on some computers.

Documentation, including installation instructions,
can be found at
`Read the docs <https://github.com/ctn-waterloo/nengo_theano>`_.

Development is hosted at
`Github <https://github.com/ctn-waterloo/nengo_theano>`_
for those interested in getting involved in its development.
