Code style
==========

We try to stick to
`PEP8 <http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/#introduction>`_.

We use ``numpydoc`` and
`NumPy guidelines <https://github.com/numpy/numpy/blob/master/doc/HOWTO_DOCUMENT.rst.txt>`_
for docstrings, as they are a bit nicer to read in plain text,
and produce decent output with Sphinx.

Unit testing
