=====================
Jython implementation
=====================

Nengo has roots in the Java world (see `Nengo history <history.html>`_).
Originally, Nengo existed as a Java package,
and a scripting layer using Jython was created
to make using that Java package easier.
That scripting layer has now been reorganized
to conform to the same Nengo API that is described here.
In doing so, we can make sure that all models written
in "Nengo" look the same, except for backend specific components.

Documentation, including installation instructions,
can be found at
`Read the docs <https://github.com/ctn-waterloo/nengo_jython>`_.

Development is hosted at
`Github <https://github.com/ctn-waterloo/nengo_jython>`_
for those interested in getting involved in its development.
