Nengo
*****

Nengo is a Python library for building and simulating
large-scale brain models using the methods of the
`Neural Engineering Framework
<http://compneuro.uwaterloo.ca/research/nef.html>`_.
Nengo can create sophisticated neural simulations
with sensible defaults in few lines of code::

    import nengo
    import numpy as np
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    with nengo.Network() as net:
        sin_input = nengo.Node(output=np.sin)
        # A population of 100 neurons representing a sine wave
        sin_ens = nengo.Ensemble(n_neurons=100, dimensions=1)
        nengo.Connection(sin_input, sin_ens)
        # A population of 100 neurons representing the square of the sine wave
        sin_squared = nengo.Ensemble(n_neurons=100, dimensions=1)
        nengo.Connection(sin_ens, sin_squared, function=np.square)
        # View the decoded output of sin_squared
        squared_probe = nengo.Probe(sin_squared, synapse=0.01)
    sim = nengo.Simulator(net)
    sim.run(5.0)
    plt.plot(sim.trange(), sim.data[squared_probe])
    plt.show()

Yet, Nengo is highly extensible and flexible.
You can define your own neuron types and learning rules,
get input directly from hardware, drive robots,
and even simulate your model on a completely
different neural simulator.

Examples
========

Nengo creates these models using the principles of the
`Neural Engineering Framework <http://compneuro.uwaterloo.ca/research/nef.html>`_.
The first set of examples explains these three principles:
*representation*, *transformation*, and *dynamics*.

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 2

   representation
   transformation
   dynamics

Putting these three principles together allows us to scale
these examples up to larger networks that do more complex functions.
